**Narrator** is a cross-platform desktop application to **fluidly define interactive, zoomable, scale-less network diagrams** (also called node-link diagrams) that **communicate dependency between information** in a **visually compelling and consistent manner**. We call these diagrams "narratives". They are represented as [RDF](http://www.w3.org/RDF/) files with links to external resources (e.g. images and documents) and can be published to the web as applets.

Narrator was originally developed by Ben Suter and John Haymaker at [Stanford University](http://www.stanford.edu/), has been used by students in Dr. Haymaker's courses in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](http://cee.stanford.edu), and remains the subject of further academic research at [CIFE](http://cife.stanford.edu/). A collection of published narratives is available at http://narratives.stanford.edu/community/.

Future plans include a server-based repository for narratives, providing multi-user collaborative read-write access and publishing for the public.

Narrator has been used to create process maps, use case diagrams, organization charts, flow charts, timelines, for non-hierarchical document organization, and to represent dependencies within a single and multiple CAD models. How will you use Narrator?
